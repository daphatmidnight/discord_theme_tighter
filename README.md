# Discord Theme Tighter
Discord was still too cozy. So I actually took AlexFlipnote's theme and made it tighter. My first line on the theme is just an import to that theme. Credits to Alex.

Also, credits to PikaDude for fading animations, and credits to jakeoid for semi-monokai code highlighting.

## What file to use
* Use `theme.css` if you wanna change a lot of stuff
* Use `discord_theme_tighter_BD.theme.css` if you use BetterDiscord
* Use `discord_theme_tighter.autotheme.css` if you use anything else such as BeautifulDiscord

## Angery questions answered

### I wanna use a background image or else I'll poison your cat.
Poisoning my cat is not cool, and I don't even have a cat yet.  
But using a background image is cool. Just uncomment some stuff. And change the link next to `--background-image` to the image of your choice. (Unless you're Tohru.)
#### But how?!
Remove the `/*` and `*/` thingies.

### I want a different default emoji for the emoji picker or else I'll get mad.
Change the image link next to `--emoji-image`. Here's where I got the blob from: https://imgur.com/a/ceGCG

### Aaaaa the servers are all weird and there are circles I don't understaaaand!
Clam down. Red circle means new message. Green circle means you're in a voice chat there. White circle means this is the server you're currently viewing.

### Your screenshot is really mediocre.
I'm not gonna make another one for now.

### I really don't like what you did to the search popup and such.
Neither did I. It was a lazy fix.

### Why didn't you make it a plugin for Discord_Theme?
Because my changes felt a bit too personal and opinionised. I added changes upon changes and now it does not really have a single purpose anymore (so, Discord Theme Tighter is not really the best name since I did more than tighten it up).

However, feel free to cherrypick stuff and make it its own plugin and such. I don't mind at all.

### I wanna insult you in your face. (Or have a nice chat. Or bring up an issue with the theme.)
Okay just contact me on Discord: `unit#1753`
